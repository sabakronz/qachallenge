Today, with AI, computers take on more tasks usually done by humans, with an increase in efficiency and productivity. However, We understand the implications of AI, and the potential danger of not having visibility into how it affects the real world. There is a lack of trust in AI outcomes because often AI models can be opaque.   We started Fiddler because we believe there is a need for a new kind of Explainable AI Platform.
