Today, with AI, computers take on more tasks usually done by humans, with an increase in efficiency and productivity. However, We understand the implications of AI, and the potential danger of not having visibility into how it affects the real world. There is a lack of trust in AI outcomes because often AI models can be opaque.   We started Fiddler because we believe there is a need for a new kind of Explainable AI Platform. One that enables organizations to get ahead of these issues by building trustworthy, transparent, and understandable AI solutions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWho We Are\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\nOur team is motivated by helping the world to unlock the AI BlackBox.

Our open digital payments platform gives PayPal’s 305 million active account holders the confidence to connect and transact in new and powerful ways, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. Through a combination of technological innovation and strategic partnerships, PayPal creates better ways to manage and move money, and offers choice and flexibility when sending payments, paying or getting paid.

These platforms combined are responsible for processing more than half of PayPal’s transactions worldwide, so this is a high-stakes role – there are very few mission critical APIs like this in the world, with this kind of scale and complexity, and that power so much commerce and so many businesses worldwide.
